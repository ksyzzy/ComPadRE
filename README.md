  <i>Compression Pads Reassurer

# ComPadRE
ComPadRE is a cross-platform desktop application which helps you choose an appropriate compression pad for your civil engineering project. This project aims to help me learn Java and improve as a software developer while hopefully providing civil engineers with a tool to make the toilsome and cumbersome work of choosing a suitable compression pad easier. All computations are done based on the compression pad manufacturers' catalogues loaded by the application in a form of packages. Those are posted in this repository and can be downloaded by the application either manually or set to automatically check for updates.

# Project's backlog
You can find the project backlog [here](https://trello.com/b/CA3bMqzG/application-for-compression-pads-calculation) on Trello.\
The workflow diagram is available [here](https://github.com/kushiji/ComPadRE/blob/main/diagrams/Trello_Workflow.svg).

# Disclaimer
While great efforts are put into creation of ComPadRE to make sure it becomes a semi-automated powerful computer-aided design tool for civil engineers, BY NO MEANS CAN ITS DEVELOPER BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY HARM DONE WHICH RESULTED FROM THE USE OF THIS APPLICATION. No guarantee is given for the compression pads specification to be up-to-date with manufacturers' catalogues, even if the developer is making sure that those stay updated. Moreover, ABSOLUTELY NO GUARANTEE IS GIVEN for the calculations made by the application to be infailliable. By using this application YOU agree that YOU are ENTIRELY responsible for every design decision and calculations made for YOUR civil engineering project.
