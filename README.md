# ComPadRE
ComPadRE is a Windows Desktop application which helps to choose an appropriate compression pad for your civil engineering project. This project aims to help me learn Java and improve as a software developer while hopefully helping civil engineers with toilsome and cumbersome work of choosing a suitable compression pad. 

# Project's backlog
You can find the project's backlog [here](https://trello.com/b/CA3bMqzG/application-for-compression-pads-calculation) on Trello.
