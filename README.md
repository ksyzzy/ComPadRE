  <i>Compression Pads Reassurer
    <br> provides support and takes the stress away</i>
  <br>

# ComPadRE
ComPadRE is a cross-platform desktop application which helps to choose an appropriate compression pad for your civil engineering project. This project aims to help me learn Java and improve as a software developer while hopefully helping civil engineers with toilsome and cumbersome work of choosing a suitable compression pad. 

# Project's backlog
You can find the project's backlog [here](https://trello.com/b/CA3bMqzG/application-for-compression-pads-calculation) on Trello.\
The workflow diagram is available [here](https://github.com/kushiji/ComPadRE/blob/main/diagrams/Trello_Workflow.svg).
