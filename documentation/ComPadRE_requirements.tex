\part{Functional requirements}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Ability to put in information such as: force value, beam width, lower
cover, top cover, hole diameter, pad thickness, number of holes.
\item Make calculations based on the selected type of the compression pad
according to manufacturer's specification.
\item Make several extra calculations for reference for the user to check
and do not stop at the first one which meets requirements.
\item Prepare checking and validation mechanism to see if all requirements
are met.
\item Present final dimensions of the compression pad and check if such
pads are available to order from the specific manufacturer based on
the information available in the provided product specification. 
\item Ability to easily request an update of the pad specification if the
manufacturer made any changes in the product. Also an ability to quickly
and efortlessly 
\item An ability to calculate and check if the rotation of the beam meets
requirements.
\item An ability to save current calculations to the file to quickly load
it up.
\item An ability to export current calculations as the report file in DOC
or PDF format.
\end{enumerate}

\part{Non-functional requirements}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Application should be relatively lightweight.
\item Preferably as stable as it can be without crashes and freezes.
\item The current calculations should be saved as temporary data in case
of unexpected program termination with the ability to immediately
load it up on application startup.
\item The UI should be as friendly as it can be.
